## Overview

I'm working on building an airplane drone that I can use for aerial photography.

## Background

One of my childhood dreams was to find a way to take my own aerial photographs,
but back then it was pretty well out of my reach.  Film was expensive, computers were big, and I couldn't afford remote controlled airplane parts.  But now there are digital cameras, Raspberry Pis, and I'm not a child anymore.
