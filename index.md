Welcome to Codewrench!
My name is Daniel Schilling, and this is where I share my personal projects, the things I'm learning about, and my thoughts on life, the universe, and everything.
I love lots of different things, including: math, maps, photography, robots, computer programming, 3D printing, and the Korean language.
Most of all I love Jesus.
If you love any of these things, hopefully you will find something you like here.

I am a Senior Technology Consultant/Architect at [JSWco](http://jsw.co/).
If your business is looking for an experienced team of passionate and skilled software developers, then please check JSWco out.
We would love to tackle whatever challenge you have to throw our way.

If on the other hand you want to learn about my personal projects and thoughts, then you are in the right place.
Welcome!
