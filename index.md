My name is Daniel Schilling.
I love math, maps, photography, robots, computer programming, 3D printing, the Korean language, my wife, and long walks on the beach, except for the sand, and the seawater, and seaweed...
on second thought maybe I don't like the beach.  Long walks are okay, though.

But most of all I love Jesus.

I am a Senior Technology Consultant/Architect at [JSWco](http://jsw.co/).
If your business is looking for a team of passionate and skilled software developers, then please check JSWco out.
We would love to tackle whatever challenge you have to throw our way.

If on the other hand you want to hear me ramble about my personal projects, DIY-type stuff, etc., then you are in the right place.
Welcome!
